# About me, Lewin Probst, M.Sc.

My name is Lewin Probst, I am a senior software engineer with  more than 15 years of IT experience. I have seen many different  programming languages along the way such as HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript,  C++, C#, Python just to name a few. Since beginning of 2020 I added Rust to my portfolio.

## openprobst.dev initiative

Because I am convinced about the principles of the language  construction and its ecosystem, I want to support everyone using this  technology and at the same time push the language forward on crate level. Therefore I started the initiative openprobst.dev to become a Rust full-time open-source engineer supporting the community, sponsored by the community. Besides working on my own crates, I support you by solving issues, adding new features or by creating new projects that  helps solving complex tasks.

No matter your level of experience, you are always welcome to get in touch via the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nx7YtsjEbT), or directly create a specific task in the [repository](https://github.com/emirror-de/openprobst/issues). For more information, see [how it works section](https://openprobst.dev/#how-it-works).

If you decide to financial contribute, you will be granted attractive additional services e.g. priority bug fixing on third party crates.

Following the [open source principles](https://opensource.com/open-source-way), I work as transparent as possible, so you can always have a look at the [openprobst dashboard](https://github.com/users/emirror-de/projects/2).  Issues created in the [openprobst repository](https://github.com/emirror-de/openprobst/issues) will be added to my to-do list automatically.
